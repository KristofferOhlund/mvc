Graveyard Awakening - You wake up with a dull ache at the back of your head. The ground beneath you is cold and damp,
covered in
rotting
leaves and tangled roots. A thick fog clings to the earth, and crooked tombstones loom like silent watchers
around you.
Everything is quiet. Too quiet.
Slung over your shoulders is an old, worn backpack. You don’t remember putting it there. You don’t remember how
you got
here.
In front of you, at the center of the graveyard, lies a skeleton — half-buried, its ribs wrapped around a rusted
sword
driven deep into the soil. The body looks ancient, but something about it feels… recent. As if it died with
purpose.
Protecting something. Or sealing something away.
Around you:
A crumbling stone wall encircles the graveyard.
A broken wooden cross leans against a moss-covered headstone.
Footprints trail off into a shadowy grove beyond the fence.
A strange amulet, half-buried near the skeleton, catches the faint light.
The air is heavy. You feel it in your chest — something watches from beyond the mist.
