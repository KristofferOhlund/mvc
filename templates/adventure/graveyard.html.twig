You wake up with a dull ache at the back of your head. The ground beneath you is cold and damp,
covered in
rotting
leaves and tangled roots. A thick fog clings to the earth, and crooked tombstones loom like silent watchers
around you.
Everything is quiet. Too quiet.
In front of you, at the center of the graveyard, lies a skeleton — half-buried, its ribs wrapped around a rusted
sword
driven deep into the soil. The body looks ancient, but something about it feels… recent. As if it died with
purpose.
Protecting something. Or sealing something away. A shovel is thrown next to the skeleton, is there something burried
beneath?
