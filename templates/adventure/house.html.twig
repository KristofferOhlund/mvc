The narrow path winds its way up the grassy hill, leading you to a small, timeworn cottage. Its thatched roof sags
slightly with age, and the red door stands closedâ€”silent, yet inviting. Wind whispers through the nearby trees, as
if
urging you forward. You feel a strange warmth from within. What secrets lie beyond the door? {% if "Key" in backpack|join(", ") %} <br>Hmm, maybe the key that i found can unlock the door?

{% else %}
If only i had a key to open
the door with.. But nevermind, i have a dragon to kill
